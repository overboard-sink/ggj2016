DEMON TORCH
===========

You are a demon. You are sent by your master to light the flames of hell so that he may come back and conquer earth, but first you have to get past the monks, bruisers, and other holy warriors.

Play as Pwom, the kitten-and-puppy-eating monk-slaying purple demon as you light the way for your dark master!
